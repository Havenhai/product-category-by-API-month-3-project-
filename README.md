Modification of the e-commerce website project that was done previously with HTML and CSS.

In this modification, JavaScript was incorporated with the help of a free API (fakestoreapi).
The website now has a category section and with JavaScript, interactivity is seen.

This project is designed to help with learning how to incorporate JavaScript in websites.
